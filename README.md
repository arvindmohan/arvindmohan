### Hi there - I'm Arvind Mohan 👋
- :ocean: I’m a scientist at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) working on deep learning for computational physics, especially turbulence in fluids.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on differentiable programming based surrogate/reduced-order models for engineering applications.
- 🌱 I enjoy programming in Julia and Python.
- 👯 I’m always looking for new collaborations, productive discussions and ideas.
- 📫 How to reach me: a r v i n d m (at) l a n l. g o v 
- :books: My published work can be found in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kr8XW9oAAAAJ&hl=en)  - Feel free to reach out to know more!
- ❗Most of my codes from publications are not open-source on Github (yet) as additional approvals are needed from my funding sponsors/employer. Please contact me if you have any questions from my papers, I'd be happy to chat.

Thank you!
