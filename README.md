- 🔭 I’m currently working on differentiable programming based surrogate/reduced-order models for engineering applications.
- 🌱 I enjoy programming in Julia and Python.
- 👯 I’m always looking for new collaborations, productive discussions and ideas.
- 📫 How to reach me: a r v i n d m (at) l a n l. g o v 
- :books: My published work can be found in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kr8XW9oAAAAJ&hl=en)  - Feel free to reach out to know more!
